It is divided into two parts: \\n- Part #1: For patients that may be symptomatic to flag the need to conduct a full diagnostic evaluation to rule out anthrax before proceeding with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) \\n- Part #2: For patients  who are  asymptomatic (not displaying signs and symptoms of anthrax), it provides recommended PEP regimen"

Includes immediate treatment with antimicrobials and vaccine and follow-up administration of subsequent vaccines to complete the recommended 3-dose vaccination series."
